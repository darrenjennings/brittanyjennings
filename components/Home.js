      ðŸŽ» Cello Philosophy - You do not "arrive" one day playing your cello perfectly and knowing all of its nuances.
      Being a musician and a cellist is a journey of imaginatively exploring a complex and beautiful instrument. The
      cello is an instrument that gives joy to the musicians and listeners alike.
